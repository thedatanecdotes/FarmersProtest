0,"At the protest Singhu border where farmers are protesting against the farm laws, in New Delhi on Tuesday. ( BKU (Dakuanda) general secretary Jagmohan Singh Patiala explains point-by-point why farmers are objecting to Centre’s offer. So, the Centre is not ready to take any responsibility on this issue. This is also being proposed under the pressures of farmer organisations. In such cases farmers are unable to repay the loans and have no option other than to sell/lose their lands. Even in the USA, where huge subsidies are given for the agriculture sector the farmers are forced to commit suicides.” Therefore the Modi government wants to bring the power sector under the central control. ”Centre’s proposal: Willing to amend law on controlling NCR pollutionFarmers’ objection: “Union government thinks that stubble burning of paddy is responsible for pollution in Delhi and so they have enacted a legislation of stringent punishments and heavy fines up to Rs 1 crore for the alleged violators.",https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/government-farmer-talks-deadlock-explained-7106698/,NEGATIVE,0.998404860496521
1,"Farmer protest outside national capital New Delhi | Photo Credit: Times NowKey Highlights Since 26 November, farmers from Punjab and Haryana have laid siege to the national capital. The farmers are protesting against 2 Farm Bills that the Rajya Sabha recently passed: (1) the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and (2) the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020.The two bills had already cleared the lower house – the Lok Sabha. The APMCs are government-controlled marketing yards or mandis. The farmer and an ordained buyer can strike a deal before the production happens. State governments are prohibited from levying any market fee, cess or levy outside APMC areas. Why has the Centre not reached out?The Central ministers and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have tried reassuring the farmers that the government has no plans to end the government procurement system nor the MSP policy. But fear, misconceptions persist and the two sparring parties have not had meaningful negotiations. Why are the farmers upset?The farmers of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Haryana are angry with the provisions of these Bills as they are afraid that these Bills may be the platform that the government (at the Centre) is setting up for the replacement or scrapping of the otherwise robust support system prevalent in their states for the purchase of their crops. The state-government driven crop produce procurement infrastructure in these areas is very good.",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/what-is-the-farm-bill-and-why-are-farmers-protesting-against-it/689215,POSITIVE,0.9858541488647461
2,Key provisions of the lawsThe key provisions of new farm laws are intended to help small and marginal farmers (86% of total farmers) who donât have means to either bargain for their produce to get a better price or invest in technology to improve the productivity of farms. The Act on Agri market allows farmers to sell their produce outside APMC âmandisâ to whoever they want. Anyone can buy their produce even at their farm gates. What the government saysThe three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. The 'Bharat Bandh' has been called by the farmers unions who have been protesting the three farm laws enacted in the Monsoon Session of Parliament. Major political parties on Sunday came out in strong support of the bandh.,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-are-new-farm-laws-and-and-why-farmers-are-protesting/articleshow/79609234.cms,NEGATIVE,0.8579246997833252
3,"Farmers shout slogans during their 'Delhi Chalo' protest march against the Centre's new farm laws, at Singhu border on December 2, 2020 in New Delhi, India. India's parliament passed three contentious bills in September. Agriculture is the primary source of livelihood for about 58% of India's population but accounts for around 15% of GDP.Three farm reform billsThe first one would allow farmers to sell their produce directly to traders and companies, including supermarkets and online grocers, as well as to retail customers — whoever offers a higher price. Anecdotal evidence shows that free market prices are generally lower than the designated (minimum support prices). It will allow buyers to purchase, store and distribute food items such as like cereals, pulses, onions, potatoes, oils without restriction. The government said it expects this to help drive up investments and modernization of the food supply chain. Many farmers have fallen into debt that's led to a rise in farmer suicides in recent years. The worry is that if MSPs are dropped, large corporations could potentially set prices that would put farmers at a further disadvantage.",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/03/why-india-farmers-are-protesting-three-farm-reform-bills.html,NEGATIVE,0.991567075252533
4,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Thousands of Indian farmers angered by farm laws that they say threaten their livelihoods have intensified their protests by blocking highways and camping out on the outskirts of the capital Delhi. Higher production puts pressure on the FCI to buy extra supplies from farmers, resulting in overflowing state warehouses and a ballooning subsidy bill that often pushes up the budget deficit. Despite sitting on massive mounds of rice and wheat, the FCI finds it challenging to export as the annual rise in MSPs and its own storage costs make FCI’s rice and wheat more expensive than world prices, making overseas sales uneconomic. While Punjab and Haryana sell almost their entire rice and wheat output to FCI, the government agency’s procurement in Bihar has remained at less than 2% of the state’s total production.",https://www.reuters.com/article/india-farms-protests-explainer/explainer-indias-multi-billion-dollar-food-programme-is-at-the-heart-of-farmers-protests-idUSKBN28E1VK,NEGATIVE,0.9991742968559265

6,"Farmers in several Indian states are protesting against three new bills the government says will open up the tightly-controlled agriculture sector to free-market forces. Rashpinder Singh, a farmerThe main opposition Congress party has called the bills “black law” and “pro-corporate”. For decades, the Indian farmer was bound by various constraints and bullied by middlemen. Farmers, particularly in the states of Punjab and Haryana, have protested against the government move [Narinder Nanu/AFP] The new laws give farmers additional choices to sell their produce anywhere in the country, in contrast to the earlier situation where inter-state trade was not allowed. State governments, which earn an income through transactions at mandis, stand to lose out on tax revenues as trade moves out of state or into the domain of private deals. It is preposterous to believe that farmers who have small land-holdings will have any bargaining power over private players. Harvinder Singh Lakhowal, 53, member of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, the group spearheading agitation against the bills in Punjab[Photo courtesy: Harvinder Singh Lakhowal] All assurances given by the government regarding the MSP have not been provided to farmers in writing, they are all verbal assurances. If a farmer gets into a dispute regarding her/his contract with a private company, it will be very difficult for the farmer to have the dispute settled in her/his favour. Agriculture has been deliberately kept improvised. Farmers have now the freedom to sell the crops to anyone. There is a lack of regulatory oversight and price-setting body. The farmers in the states of Punjab and Haryana are worried that these bills are only the beginning of something larger.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/23/why-are-indian-farmers-protesting-against-new-farm-bills,NEGATIVE,0.9991285800933838
